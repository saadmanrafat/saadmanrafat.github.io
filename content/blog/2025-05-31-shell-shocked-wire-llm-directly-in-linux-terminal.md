faqs:
  - question: "Can I use arkterm with other LLM providers besides Groq?"
    answer: "Currently arkterm is designed for Groq's API, but the architecture is modular. The codebase could be extended to support other providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models like Ollama."
  - question: "What happens if I don't have internet access?"
    answer: "arkterm requires internet connectivity to access Groq's API. For offline scenarios, you could modify the code to use local models via Ollama or similar tools, though this would require code changes."
  - question: "How accurate are the AI-generated commands?"
    answer: "Accuracy depends on query specificity and the chosen model. Llama 3.1 70B typically provides highly accurate commands, while the 8B model is faster but may require more specific prompting for complex tasks."
  - question: "Can arkterm learn from my previous commands and adapt?"
    answer: "Currently arkterm maintains session-based context but doesn't learn from historical commands. This feature could be added by analyzing shell history and incorporating patterns into the system prompt."
  - question: "Why do I get 'command execution disabled' messages?"
    answer: "Command execution is disabled by default as a safety measure. Enable it by setting 'allow_command_execution: true' in your ~/.aiterm/config.yaml file."

# Shell Shocked: Wire an LLM Directly into Your Linux Terminal


## The Philosophy: The Terminal Revolution You Didn't See Coming
Inspired by a [Wrap.dev](https://app.warp.dev/referral/EEGVZM) engineer's description of their interface as a way to "tell your computer what to do" rather than just chat, I explored [Wrap.dev](https://app.warp.dev/referral/EEGVZM) and developed my own minimal viable product for development. This project draws inspiration from [Wrap.dev](https://app.warp.dev/referral/EEGVZM), aiming to create a comparable tool, though less sophisticated.

Picture this: You're staring at a blank terminal, trying to remember the exact `find` command syntax to locate all Python files modified in the last week. Instead of fumbling through man pages or Stack Overflow, you type:

![Arkterm an open-source alternative to Warp.dev](/assets/images/blog/arkterm.gif)

```bash
> find all python files changed in the last 7 days
```

And your terminal responds with the exact command you need, explains what it does, and offers to run it for you. Welcome to **arkterm** – where your Linux terminal becomes an AI-native workspace.

## What Is arkterm?

`arkterm` is an open-source tool that transforms your terminal into an intelligent assistant by integrating large language models directly into your shell environment. Unlike traditional chatbots that live in browsers, arkterm brings AI into the very heart of your development workflow – the command line.

Built with Python and powered by Groq's lightning-fast LLM API, arkterm bridges the gap between natural language and shell commands, making your terminal understand context, intent, and even your current project structure.

## Why Your Terminal Needs AI (And Why Now)

### The Problem with Traditional Command Lines

Modern developers juggle hundreds of commands across multiple tools, frameworks, and systems. The cognitive overhead of remembering syntax, flags, and edge cases slows down even experienced engineers. Traditional solutions like aliases and scripts only scratch the surface.

### The AI Advantage

arkterm leverages the power of models like Llama 3.1 and Mixtral to:

- **Understand Context**: Knows your current directory, project type, and system environment
- **Translate Intent**: Converts natural language queries into precise shell commands
- **Explain Actions**: Shows you what commands do before executing them
- **Learn Patterns**: Adapts to your workflow and preferences

## Getting Started: From Zero to AI Terminal in 60 Seconds

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- A free Groq API key ([get one here](https://groq.com/))
- uv package manager (optional but recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/saadmanrafat/arkterm.git
cd arkterm

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv pip install -e .

# Or with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Create configuration file
arkterm --setup
```

This creates a YAML configuration file at `~/.aiterm/config.yaml`:

```yaml
API:
  api_key: "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY_HERE"
  model: "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"
  api_base: "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"

SETTINGS:
  allow_command_execution: false
  max_tokens: 2048
```

Add your Groq API key and you're ready to go!

## Core Features That Make arkterm Shine

### 1. Natural Language Command Generation

Instead of memorizing complex syntax, describe what you want:

```bash
> arkterm "compress all log files older than 30 days"
```

**Output:**
```bash
I'll help you compress log files older than 30 days. Here's the command:

find /var/log -name "*.log" -type f -mtime +30 -exec gzip {} \;

This command:
- Searches in /var/log directory
- Finds files with .log extension
- Filters files older than 30 days (-mtime +30)
- Compresses each file with gzip

```

### 2. Interactive Mode for Continuous Assistance

Launch interactive mode for ongoing AI assistance:

```bash
arkterm -i
```

```
> check disk usage for directories over 1GB

Here's how to check disk usage for large directories:

```bash
du -h --max-depth=1 | grep '[0-9]G'


This command shows directory sizes and filters for those over 1GB.

> !exec du -h --max-depth=1 | grep '[0-9]G'
Executing: du -h --max-depth=1 | grep '[0-9]G'
2.1G    ./node_modules
1.4G    ./datasets
3.2G    ./models
```

### 3. Context-Aware Project Detection

arkterm automatically detects your project type and provides relevant suggestions:

```python
def _detect_project_type(cwd: str) -> str:
    """Detects project type based on files in current directory"""
    files = os.listdir(cwd) if os.path.exists(cwd) else []
    
    if "package.json" in files:
        return "Node.js project detected"
    elif "requirements.txt" in files or "pyproject.toml" in files:
        return "Python project detected"
    elif "Cargo.toml" in files:
        return "Rust project detected"
    elif "go.mod" in files:
        return "Go project detected"
    elif ".git" in files:
        return "Git repository detected"
    else:
        return "General directory"
```

This context gets passed to the AI, enabling project-specific suggestions.

### 4. Safety-First Command Execution

arkterm prioritizes safety with built-in protections:

```python
# Safety guidelines built into the system prompt
SAFETY_RULES = """
- Never execute commands that could damage the system
- Always warn about destructive operations (rm -rf, format, etc.)
- Prefer safer alternatives (mv to trash vs rm, etc.)
- Ask before modifying system files or configurations
"""
```

## Advanced Use Cases

### DevOps Automation

```bash
> arkterm "show me all docker containers using more than 500MB memory"
```

**Response:**
```bash
docker stats --format "table {{.Container}}\t{{.Name}}\t{{.MemUsage}}" --no-stream | awk 'NR>1 && $3 ~ /[5-9][0-9][0-9]M|[0-9]+G/ {print}'
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
> arkterm "find all 404 errors in nginx logs from last hour"
```

**Response:**
```bash
grep "404" /var/log/nginx/access.log | awk -v cutoff=$(date -d '1 hour ago' '+%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S') '$4 > "["cutoff'
```

### System Monitoring

```bash
> arkterm "alert me if CPU usage goes above 80%"
```

**Response:**
```bash
while true; do
  cpu=$(top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/%us,//')
  if (( $(echo "$cpu > 80" | bc -l) )); then
    notify-send "High CPU Usage" "CPU usage is ${cpu}%"
  fi
  sleep 60
done
```

## The Technical Architecture

### Core Components

To begin, establish a repository using [UV, a Python package manager](https://saadman.dev/blog/2025-05-15-a-no-nonsense-guide-to-uv-a-python-package-manager/) designed to streamline dependency management and virtual environments. Next, navigate to [Groq](https://groq.com/) (not Grok), register for their service, and get a free API key from their developer portal. Groq offers production-ready models such as `gemma2-9b-it`, `meta-llama/Llama-Guard-4-12B`, `llama-3.1-8b-instant` and more at no cost, though API rate limits and context token window restrictions apply. A comprehensive list of their [supported models is provided](https://console.groq.com/docs/models).

The initial approach considered LangChain, but its intricate nature led to its exclusion from this project. As a result, we will use the `requests` library to communicate with Groq's LLMs through API calls. It is important to note that Groq is not currently supported by LangChain. However, as engineers, we are adept at finding solutions.

```python
# Core workflow
def fetch_response(query: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    """Main AI interaction pipeline"""
    
    # 1. Gather system context
    system_info = fetch_system_info()
    
    # 2. Create enhanced prompt with context
    system_prompt = get_enhanced_system_prompt(system_info)
    
    # 3. Call Groq API
    payload = {
        "model": config["API"]["model"],
        "messages": [
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ],
        "max_tokens": config["SETTINGS"]["max_tokens"],
        "temperature": 0.7
    }
    
    # 4. Parse and return response
    response = requests.post(api_endpoint, json=payload)
    return response.json()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

### Command Block Parsing

arkterm intelligently extracts executable commands from AI responses:

```python
def parse_command_blocks(response: str) -> list[str]:
    """Extract command blocks from markdown-formatted AI responses"""
    command_blocks = []
    current_block = []
    in_code_block = False
    
    for line in response.splitlines():
        stripped = line.strip()
        if stripped.startswith("```"):
            in_code_block = not in_code_block
            if not in_code_block and current_block:
                command_blocks.append("\n".join(current_block))
                current_block.clear()
        elif in_code_block:
            current_block.append(line)
    
    return command_blocks
```

## Why Groq? The Speed Advantage

arkterm uses Groq's inference engine for several key reasons:

1. **Blazing Fast**: Sub-second response times for real-time terminal interaction
2. **Cost Effective**: Free tier with generous limits perfect for CLI usage
3. **Multiple Models**: Access to Llama 3.1, Mixtral, and Gemma models
4. **High Quality**: Production-ready models with excellent code generation capabilities

## Configuration and Customization

### Model Selection

Switch between different models based on your needs:

```bash
# In interactive mode
> !model

Available Groq Models:
- llama3-8b-8192 (Fast, efficient)
- llama3-70b-8192 (More powerful)
- mixtral-8x7b-32768 (Mixtral model)
- gemma-7b-it (Google's Gemma model)
- deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b (Distilled Llama model)

Currently using: llama3-8b-8192
Change model? (Enter model name or press Enter to keep current):
```

### Safety Configuration

Control command execution permissions:

```yaml
SETTINGS:
  allow_command_execution: true  # Enable command execution
  max_tokens: 4096              # Increase for longer responses
```

## Best Practices and Pro Tips

### 1. Be Specific with Context

```bash
# Instead of: "delete old files"
# Try: "delete log files older than 7 days in /var/log"
```

### 2. Use Interactive Mode for Complex Tasks

For multi-step operations, interactive mode maintains context:

```bash
arkterm -i
> I need to set up a Python web scraper project
> create a virtual environment for it
> install requests and beautifulsoup4
> create a basic scraper template
```

### 3. Leverage Project Detection

arkterm automatically understands your project context:

```bash
# In a Node.js project
> arkterm "add a new dependency for testing"
# Suggests: npm install --save-dev jest

# In a Python project  
> arkterm "add a new dependency for testing"
# Suggests: pip install pytest
```
